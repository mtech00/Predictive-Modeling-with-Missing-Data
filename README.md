# Predictive Modeling with Missing Data

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a classifier to predict the target variable `y` based on various features provided in the datasets. The datasets consist of training, validation, and test sets. The project addresses missing data, encodes categorical variables, trains a Random Forest classifier, evaluates the model's performance, and visualizes the results.

### Input Files
1. `train.csv`: Contains the training data used to build the model.
2. `validation.csv`: Contains the validation data used to evaluate the model's performance during training.
3. `test.csv`: Contains the test data on which final predictions are made.

### Features
The datasets include a mix of numerical and categorical features, many of which contain missing values denoted by `?`.

### Target Variable
`y`: The target variable that we aim to predict. It is a binary variable with possible values `Yes` or `No`.

## Initial Assumptions and Challenges

### Initial Assumptions
- Missing values can be handled using simple imputation techniques.
- Categorical features need to be encoded for the model to process them.
- Random Forest would be a suitable model due to its robustness and ability to handle mixed data types.

### Challenges
- Handling a significant number of missing values.
- Encoding categorical features without losing information.
- Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
- **Categorical Features**: Missing values are replaced with the mode (most frequent value) of the respective column. This approach maintains the most likely category in the presence of missing data.
- **Numerical Features**: Missing values are replaced with the median of the respective column. The median is used because it is robust to outliers and provides a central tendency measure.

```python
def handle_missing_values(df):     
    for column in df.columns: 
        if df[column].dtype == 'object': 
            mode_value = df[column].mode()[0]             
            df[column] = df[column].fillna(mode_value)         
        else: 
            median_value = df[column].median()             
            df[column] = df[column].fillna(median_value)
```

### Encoding Categorical Features
One-hot encoding is applied to convert categorical features into a format suitable for the Random Forest model. This involves creating binary columns for each category and dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.

```python
combined_df = pd.concat([X_train, X_validation, X_test], axis=0) 
encoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False) 
combined_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(combined_df)
```

### Dropping Unnecessary Columns
The `index` column, if present, is dropped from the validation and test datasets before applying the one-hot encoding. This column is not required for prediction and could introduce noise into the model.

## What Worked and What Didn't

### What Worked
- **Imputation**: Using mode for categorical features and median for numerical features effectively handled missing values and improved model performance.
- **One-hot Encoding**: Successfully converted categorical features into a numerical format suitable for the Random Forest model.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Provided a robust baseline performance with a good balance between accuracy and model complexity.

### What Didn't
- **Mean Imputation**: Using the mean for numerical features resulted in poorer performance due to the influence of outliers.
- **Label Encoding**: Caused issues with the Random Forest model, likely due to the imposed ordinal relationship between categories.
- **Overfitting**: Observed when the model was too complex (e.g., too many trees in the Random Forest).

## Model Training

The Random Forest classifier was chosen due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data without extensive preprocessing. It also provides good performance and robustness against overfitting.

### Initialization and Training
The Random Forest classifier was initialized with a random state for reproducibility. The model was trained using the encoded training dataset.

```python
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42) 
clf.fit(X_train_encoded, y_train)
```

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
- **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

```python
y_validation_pred = clf.predict(X_validation_encoded) 
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_validation, y_validation_pred) 
report = classification_report(y_validation, y_validation_pred, output_dict=True) 
cm = confusion_matrix(y_validation, y_validation_pred)
```

### Validation Accuracy and Classification Report
- **Validation Accuracy**: 0.75
- **Classification Report**:
  - Class 'No':
    - Precision: 0.82 (Out of all predicted 'No', 82% were correct)
    - Recall: 0.62 (Out of all actual 'No', 62% were correctly identified)
    - F1-Score: 0.71 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)
  - Class 'Yes':
    - Precision: 0.70 (Out of all predicted 'Yes', 70% were correct)
    - Recall: 0.87 (Out of all actual 'Yes', 87% were correctly identified)
    - F1-Score: 0.78 (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)

### Confusion Matrix
Interpretation:
- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted 'Yes'.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted 'Yes' (actual 'No').
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted 'No'.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted 'No' (actual 'Yes').

## Test Set Visualization

A heatmap of the confusion matrix is displayed to visualize the performance of the model.

```python
def plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes, title='Confusion Matrix', cmap=plt.cm.Blues): 
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) 
    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap) 
    plt.title(title)     
    plt.colorbar() 
    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))     
    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation=45)     
    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes) 
    fmt = 'd'     
    thresh = cm.max() / 2.     
    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):         
        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt), horizontalalignment="center", color="white" if cm[i, j] > thresh else "black") 
    plt.ylabel('True label')     
    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')     
    plt.tight_layout()
```

## Predictions

### Process
The trained model is used to generate predictions on the test dataset. These predictions are saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

```python
y_test_pred = clf.predict(X_test_encoded) 
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'index': test_df.index, 'y_pred': y_test_pred}) 
output_df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
```

### Visualization
A count plot of the predicted labels on the test set is generated to understand the distribution of predictions.

```python
sns.countplot(y_test_pred) 
plt.title('Test Set Predictions') 
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label') 
plt.ylabel('Count') 
plt.show()
```
